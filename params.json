{"name":"Matlab-hsmm","body":"## A Matlab Library for Sampling HDP-HSMMs ##\r\nThis code provides a simple but extensible library for Bayesian inference in\r\n(HDP-)HSMMs and (HDP-)HMMs.\r\n\r\nThis is a bare-bones Matlab implementation of the HSMM library I maintain for\r\nPython, [pyhsmm](http://mattjj.github.com/pyhsmm). However, the basics are all\r\nhere, and it should be easy to extend for your purposes (if even just adding\r\nsome of the observation or duration distribution classes present in the Python\r\nversion).\r\n\r\nThere is an included `demo.m` file, which you can run to produce figures like\r\nthe ones below.\r\n\r\n![truth](http://www.mit.edu/~mattjj/github/matlab-hsmm/truth.png)\r\n![sampled](http://www.mit.edu/~mattjj/github/matlab-hsmm/sampled.png)\r\n","tagline":"","google":"UA-30750996-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
